# 📑 HTML Paragraph Logic

The HTML code provided focuses on the most common way to display text on the web. By using semantic tags, you tell the browser exactly what kind of information is being presented.

## 🏗️ Structural Breakdown

* **`<html lang="en">`**: Tells the browser and search engines that the primary language of the page is English.
* **`<meta charset="utf-8" />`**: Ensures that all characters (like emojis or special symbols) display correctly.
* **`<p>` Tags**: These define "Block-level" content. Each paragraph is treated as its own separate box by the browser.

## 🔍 Understanding the Comments

In HTML, comments are written as ``. These are crucial for:

1. **Organization**: Labeling sections like "Navigation" or "Sidebar."
2. **Collaboration**: Explaining to other developers why a certain tag was used.
3. **Debugging**: Temporarily "hiding" code without deleting it to see if it fixes an error.
