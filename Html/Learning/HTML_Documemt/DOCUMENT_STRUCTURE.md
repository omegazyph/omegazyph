# 📑 Basic Document Structure

This file combines the two most fundamental elements of web content: headings and paragraphs. Together, they form the "Skeleton" of almost every informational website.

## 🏗️ Element Interaction

In a standard document, elements follow a specific logical flow:

1. **The Heading (`<h1>`)**: Acts as the main subject of the page. It provides the largest text and the highest level of importance for search engines.
2. **The Paragraph (`<p>`)**: Provides the supporting detail. It is a block-level element that automatically adds vertical space to separate ideas.

## 🔍 Why This Matters

* **Hierarchy**: By placing an `<h1>` above a `<p>`, you create a visual hierarchy that makes the page easy for users to scan.
* **Semantic Meaning**: Using these specific tags instead of just resizing text with CSS helps browsers understand the "Outline" of your page.
* **Metadata Alignment**: The `<title>` in your `<head>` should generally match or relate closely to your `<h1>` content for the best user experience.
