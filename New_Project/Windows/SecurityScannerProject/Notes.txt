How this works (The Logic)

    Registry Keys: 
        Spyware usually adds a record to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. 
        When Windows boots, it checks this "folder" and runs every path listed inside.

    The Scanner: 
        The Python script acts as a viewer for that specific registry folder.

    Removal: 
        By using winreg.DeleteValue, the script "uninstalls" the instruction that tells Windows to open the spyware. 
        
        Note: 
            This stops the program from starting, but the actual file might still be on your hard drive.
