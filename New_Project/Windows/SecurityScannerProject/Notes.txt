How this works (The Logic)

    Registry Keys: 
        Spyware usually adds a record to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run. 
        When Windows boots, it checks this "folder" and runs every path listed inside.

    The Scanner: 
        The Python script acts as a viewer for that specific registry folder.

    Removal: 
        By using winreg.DeleteValue, the script "uninstalls" the instruction that tells Windows to open the spyware. 
        
        Note: 
            This stops the program from starting, but the actual file might still be on your hard drive.

🔍 How to Spot "Real" Spyware

    Since your current HKCU (Current User) list is clean, you should check the System-Wide keys next. Spyware often hides there to gain higher permissions.

    When you run your scanner, look for these "Red Flags":

    Random Names: 
        Files like ax88jql.exe or svchost_updater.exe (malware often mimics real Windows files).

    Suspicious Folders:
         Anything running out of C:\Users\omega\AppData\Local\Temp or C:\Windows\Temp. Legitimate programs rarely stay in Temp folders.

    No Description: 
        In Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc), if you see these processes running but they have no "Publisher" or "Description," be cautious.
