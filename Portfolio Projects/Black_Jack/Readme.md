## How to Play

1. **Objective**: The goal is to beat the dealer's hand without exceeding a total of 21.
2. **Card Values**: Numbered cards are worth their face value, face cards (King, Queen, Jack) are worth 10 points each, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points, whichever is more favorable.
3. **Gameplay**: 
   - **Hit (h)**: Take another card from the dealer.
   - **Stand (s)**: Stop taking cards and end your turn.
   - **Double Down (d)**: Double your initial bet and take one more card.
   - **Split (sp)**: If you have two cards of the same value, you can split them into two separate hands, each with its bet, and play them individually.
4. **Dealer's Turn**: After players have completed their turns, the dealer reveals their face-down card and follows specific rules to determine their actions.
5. **Outcome**: The player with a hand closer to 21 than the dealer's hand wins. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they bust and lose the round.
