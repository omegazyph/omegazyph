# 256-bit Data Encryption

This project demonstrates a secure implementation of symmetric encryption using Python. It utilizes the `cryptography` library to handle sensitive data with 256-bit key logic.

## 🚀 Overview

The script performs the following security operations:

1. **Key Generation:** Creates a unique Fernet key.
2. **Encryption:** Transforms a plain-text password into a secure ciphertext.
3. **Decryption:** Reverses the process to verify data integrity and recovery.

## 🛠️ Requirements

Ensure you have the necessary library installed via pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
