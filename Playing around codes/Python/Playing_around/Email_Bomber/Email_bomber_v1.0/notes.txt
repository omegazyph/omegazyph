Email Bomber V0.1

    The program is written in Python 3 and performs better on pure Python.
    The program does work, but Gmail has a second-factor authentication system.

To-Do:

    Finish the logo.
    Find a way around the second-factor authentication.

Thoughts:

    I should create another version that sends the email directly from the command line.
    It's definitely possible.
    I guess I need to develop a 2.0 version that runs solely from the command line.
