#!/bin/bash
# This is a shebang line. It tells the operating system to execute this script using bash.

# This script is designed to continuously launch background processes.
# CAUTION: Running this script can quickly exhaust system resources (CPU, memory, process IDs)
# and may lead to system unresponsiveness or crashes. It functions similarly to a
# simple "fork bomb" or Denial of Service (DoS) attack on the local system.
# It should NOT be run on production systems or systems where stability is critical.

while true; do
    # 'while true' creates an infinite loop.
    # The commands inside this loop will execute repeatedly without end,
    # until the script process itself is manually terminated.

    # 'nohup' runs the command 'yes' in a way that makes it immune to hangups.
    # This means the 'yes' process will continue running even if the user logs out
    # or the terminal window from which the script was launched is closed.
    # This is critical for its resource-exhaustion behavior, as processes won't die easily.

    # 'yes' is a command-line utility that continuously prints the letter 'y'
    # followed by a newline, to standard output. It runs indefinitely until killed.
    # In this script, its output is redirected, so you won't see the 'y's.

    # '> /dev/null' redirects the standard output (STDOUT) of the 'yes' command
    # to /dev/null. /dev/null is a special "null device" that discards all data
    # written to it. This prevents your terminal or system logs from being flooded
    # with the 'y' characters.

    # '2>&1' redirects standard error (STDERR, file descriptor 2) to the same
    # location as standard output (STDOUT, file descriptor 1).
    # This means any error messages generated by the 'yes' command will also be
    # discarded into /dev/null, keeping the console clean.

    # '&' runs the entire 'nohup yes > /dev/null 2>&1' command in the background.
    # This is crucial: the main 'while true' loop does not wait for one 'yes' process
    # to finish before starting the next iteration and launching another.
    # This leads to a rapid accumulation of 'yes' processes, each running independently
    # in the background, consuming resources.
    nohup yes > /dev/null 2>&1 &

done

# To stop this script if it's running and causing issues:
# 1. Open a new terminal (if possible).
# 2. Find the PIDs (Process IDs) of the script and its spawned 'yes' processes:
#    ps aux | grep "while true" | grep -v grep
#    ps aux | grep "yes" | grep -v grep
# 3. Kill the main script process:
#    kill -9 <PID_of_the_script_bash_process>
# 4. Kill all 'yes' processes:
#    killall yes
#    (Alternatively: pkill -f "yes" -U $(whoami) to kill only your user's yes processes)

# This script is primarily useful for demonstrating how an unchecked loop
# launching background processes can quickly consume system resources.
# It is NOT intended for legitimate system operations.
