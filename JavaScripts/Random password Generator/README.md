# Random Password Generator

A lightweight, browser-based **Random Password Generator** built using HTML5 and JavaScript. This tool allows users to specify a desired password length and instantly generates a secure string of alphanumeric characters.

## 🚀 Features

* **Custom Length:** Users can generate passwords of any length (default is 7).
* **Instant Results:** Uses client-side JavaScript for immediate generation without page refreshes.
* **Modern UI:** Styled with CSS Flexbox to ensure a clean, centered interface.

## 📂 Project Structure

* `index.html`: The user interface and visual layout.
* `JavaScript.js`: The logic engine that handles character randomization.

## 🛠️ How it Works

The script uses the `Math.random()` function to pick characters from a predefined `keylist`. It loops through the list based on the user's input and returns the combined string back to the web form.
