Gate Keeper will password any page, the password being the name of the file.  

For example: mypage.html. 
password would be "mypage".  

the Stat page will go to the Gate Keeper and then enter the name of the file. that is the password 

So all you have to do is rename the page you want to protect to a longer and more complicated file name, and that will be the password that will access that page.  No, you don't have to add anything to the protected page.  

Note:
it seems this script can only protect pages that end in .html, not .htm  so be sure to rename the extensin too.
