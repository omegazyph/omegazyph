SUMMARY:
Gate Keeper is a lightweight security script that uses a 
"Filename-as-Password" logic. It allows you to protect any 
HTML page without hardcoding passwords into your JavaScript.

HOW IT WORKS:
1. The password for any page is simply the name of the file itself.
   Example: To protect a file, rename it to "SecretRoom.html".
   The password is now "SecretRoom".

2. The Start Page (index.html) triggers a centered popup window.
3. The user enters the "Password" (filename) into the popup.
4. The script attempts to fetch [Input].html and redirects the 
   main browser window to that location.

SECURITY ADVANTAGE:
You do not have to add any special code to your protected pages.
To change a password, simply rename the .html file on your server.
For higher security, use long, complicated filenames (e.g., 
"k9_Xj22_security.html").

TECHNICAL NOTES:
* FILE EXTENSIONS: This script is hardcoded to look for ".html".
  It will NOT find files ending in ".htm". Ensure all target 
  files use the full four-letter extension.

* CASE SENSITIVITY: Passwords are case-sensitive because 
  server filenames are case-sensitive.

* DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
  - Keep target pages in the same root folder as gatekeep.html.
  - Keep logic files in the /JavaScripts/ folder.
