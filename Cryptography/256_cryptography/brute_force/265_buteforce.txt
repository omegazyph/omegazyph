i was working on a login Gate and i thought of an idea to program a program that would brute force the 256 hash
	

# This will create the password hash
	the echo -n "$entered_password" | sha256sum | awk '{print $1}'

#then i would have to get a list of passwords from a file to run form 
	list_of_passwords.txt

# then run the list_of_password in the program so then it will stop on the right hash
